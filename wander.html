            One day back in sec school, I came across this quote. I found it pretty intriguing due to how countercultural/antithetical it was. The first part of this quote is pretty easy to grasp. People gravitate to things that glitter. But not everything that people/one gravitates towards is truly something of value. It runs from the thread of building treasures in heaven rather than on earth/“Crowns" by Hillsong/the parable of the merchant. You get the idea, and in fact, this was such a 2019/2020 lesson, back when we were in jc, ok, so lets get a move on, dont @ me.
            <br><br>But the second part of the quote, I never quite got the insight of it. What does “not all who wander are lost” mean?

            <br><br>There are many things to worry about. We worry about whether we have enough internships to compete with everybody else, we worry if we can get a bf/gf, we worry about what job we are going to get or what field to specialise in. We worry about how much our starting salary is and the fact that it’s like 3k less than what CS majors are getting. The fear of the future is very real, and the fear of being lost is especially so.

            <br><br>The Israelites were wanderers in the wilderness. Imagine being homeless, but not homeless in a welfare city like Singapore, but in the desert, the barren land. Although it might seem somewhat of a certainty that they were going to the Promised Land, they spent many many years lost in the wilderness. Due to their sin, generations did not even come to see the Promised Land. Not even Moses entered the Promised Land. In appearance, this was a people truly lost. Yet, the Israelite generations always celebrated the Passover, because it was a reminder that they were always the exodus generation, a chosen people brought out of Egypt, to a Promised Land. 

            <br><br>Someone, who shared their concerns with me about their future uni/major/career somehow seems to think that compared to them, I have my life figured out. But actually, nothing could be further from the truth, I don’t even know where I’ll be ending up next January (4 months later), seriously….

            <br><br>Just this other morning, I remembered when I got into a crazy argument with my mom at home. And I cried because of how much I missed my family. Staying in Singapore may never wake you to what it means to leave home, to leave family. (Unless ofc ur loved one passed or smth ok don’t @ me) It is painful and it hurts. Not so much as the first time. But it hurts bad. It makes me question why the hell am I 13574km away from my home.

            <br><br>Not all who wander are lost is a quote from JRR Tolkien, who wrote The Hobbit. And it just so happened that it was one of the few movies available on my UA2 flight to San Francisco Airport. The Hobbit tells of an incredible story when Bilbo Baggins leaves the comfort of his home and joins a company on an adventure. A big idea is that the great things in life, such as defeating evil in Gandalf’s case, are not found in places of power, prestige, or status but in the everyday deeds of courage and faith.
            <br><br>To me, Bilbo’s courage is not in the moment when he faced the mighty orcs who had already overpowered Thorin Oakenshield, the greatest dwarf who had defeated Azog the Defiler. Neither was it in the moment when he entered the Dragon’s Lair, facing a Dragon that had unimaginable power to squash the insect that is Bilbo. It is in the moment when he chose the adventure and left his small, cozy home.

            <br><br>We aren’t called to live a life that society deems perfect or the best. Neither should we live our lives on what even our parents or relatives wish. You and I are chosen for an adventure and I’m sure that there is a promised land for each of us.

            <br><br>So if you find yourself wandering and lost, go watch The Hobbit or something and Bilbo might just give you the courage that Gandalf received.
