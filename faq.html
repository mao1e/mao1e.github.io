              To be uncomfortable, to grow and because i wouldn't accept anything other than to aim high.<br><br>

              Going to NUS is the easy path, the comfortable path, the simple path. Nothing illustrates this more clearly than the admission process: you just need to submit your pdf certs and transcripts. a 5 min process. To me, studying here is purposeless. Why does an NUS degree take 4 years whereas UK Unis take 3? The NUS curriculum is full of General Education stuff that is completely unnecessary; why repeat JC/Sec Sch/Pri Sch? (US also has GE nonsense but im claiming 1 years worth of credit through IB; why NUS doesnt accept JC credits is just plain rat race mentality to me) And whats worse, all this nonsense is counted in your GPA and everything is bell curved. Im not going thru another 4 years just to mug. To me, NUS is just a factory to produce people with a certain paper.
              Going overseas has a purpose: to challenge myself, step out of my comfort zone.

              <em>College essay written 15 Oct</em>
              <br>“The Commander Officer has decided on 3 days of confinement as your punishment”. My heart sank on those words. Nobody wants to be in the wrong, much less punished. But what if you were not in the wrong but still punished? That’s a new low.
              <br>As a Quartermaster Officer during my military service, I was entrusted with the management of multiple armories housing hundreds of rifles and other equipment. Amidst logistical and security demands, the introduction of a digital system aimed to simplify processes. Instead of pen and paper, we used a computer and scanner. Ironically, this transition multiplied the complexities of my role and it also had a side effect: it was impossible to rectify errors as the data was locked in the User Interface. This was why, after reporting the error to my higher-ups, the only thing I got from them was losing 3 days of leave.
              <br>Sometimes, the computer would unexpectedly crash and much progress and effort was simply wasted. My situation was also exacerbated by a toxic superior who blamed me for all these problems. I felt extremely frustrated and powerless as the system was under my jurisdiction, yet I was unable to change it.  
              <br>I always viewed CS as an esoteric field: as if there was an intellectual barrier between computer scientists and me. But I knew that I had to be on the other side: understanding computer systems rather than letting someone write programs for me. While it gives me great satisfaction and confidence to learn complex algorithms and programs, in a sense, I didn’t choose CS. Computers choose to mess with me. Every day, I wake up ready to stare down my computer screen. Some days, I get defeated by a problem and resign to sleep. But you can bet that even then, I still dream in code.

                <li>Applying as an international is near impossible because there are so much more slots than applicants. I mean Duke has 3.5 Singaporean freshman a year.
                <li>Wanted to start uni earlier too i mean why wait "another year" after ORD.
                <li>Community college is also cheaper in tuition costs than 4 year universities.

              Pretty high transfer rate, asian population. And there's alot of info on their website/reddit which other community colleges do not have. I literally planned my first year based on internet info.
              <br>De Anza is also on a quarter system which allows the option to enroll for spring quarter in April. This will give me a long enough runway to clock credits for Spring 2024 Admission to GT. Instead of the main cycle of Fall admission, Spring will have lesser applicants and a better chance.
              <br>FYI i need around 48-52 credits which is abt 80% of sophomore credits.

              TBVH, College is all about money. No college is just going to accept international students who can't pay and give them financial aid. You HAVE to pay full tuition.
              <br>Hence, looking at full tuition prices. The best one out there is Georgia Tech. This makes sense coz its in georgia where everything is cheaper - rent, wages etc. Look at UC berkeley with all the funding issues and strikes.

              <br><br>I'm going to be taking debts for everything, live like a beggar and pay down everything with income later.
              <br>Georgia tech CS Bachelor median grad salary is 113k, 80+% placement rate. Sounds alot but it rly isnt for someone 100k in debt
