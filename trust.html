            I know yall saw me going to the premium economy counter to get my flight ticket. Doesnt mean im rich ok. Theres a pretty big story behind my flight ticket.
            <br><br>Yall already know that when i started to get down to making firm plans about going, it was already pretty late. When i first started to check flight prices with the intention to buy a ticket, the flight prices had already surged more than <code><strong>80%</strong></code> since 2 weeks ago. Usually an economy seat costs about 1k but now it cost upwards of 1.8k and even close to <code><strong>2.2k</code></strong> for SIA. It was really discouraging for me because going overseas is really expensive and I was already trying my hardest to save money. Now I had to pay such high prices which would just go into the airlines pocket.
            <br><br>To give some context, when i went to japan, I had alot of trouble with booking my flight ticket and also felt this dynamic pricing surge. It was really hard to take a bet on the flight prices coming down and secure an affordable ticket. Airlines are legit damn evil. They know you have no choice. They really have you by the balls.
            <br><br>But I still tried to find a way out of this, and this is when I started learning about miles.
            <br><br>While you usually book flight tickets using money, you can also do the same using miles. Airlines sell seats for miles and usually, it is fixed. This theoretically means that the miles price doesnt fluctuate and does not experience dynamic surge pricing. However, there are actually 2 tiers of miles prices, Advantage and Saver. Saver is cheaper but they in a very limited supply.
          </p>

          <p class="fw-normal">
            Sure enough, all the saver seats were sold out and only advantage was left, at a cost of 70k miles, equivalent to <code><strong>1.4ksgd</strong></code>. still expensive though.
            <br><br>I decided to check the miles prices for premium economy tickets and witnessed what can only be described as a miracle.
          </p>

          <p class="fw-normal">
            Firstly, the saver seats just happened to be still available for 2 days out of the whole week that i was supposed to fly. I couldnt fly earlier as I didnt have my visa in time and I couldnt fly later as my school started the next week. Secondly, there just so happened to be an SIA promo going on called <em>Spontaneous Escapes</em> and there was another tier of discount on top of the already discounted Saver tickets. This double discount meant that the premium economy ticket was cheaper than the economy tickets at a price of 50k miles, equivalent to <kbd><strong>1k sgd</strong></kbd>. That's crazy.
            <br>If i were to use cash to pay for it, it would have been around <code><strong>4k sgd</code></strong>.
            <br><br>So naturally, I seized the opportunity and transfer/bought miles from grab and my dad's credit card. However, there was yet another issue. It takes some time for the miles to transfer from grab and my dads credit card to my SIA account as SIA manually validates these transfers or something. Time was ticking and next day I checked: of the 2 days left to fly, one was sold out and only 1 day was left. But eventually,some time later, the miles transferred and I bought the last flight tickets, <kbd><strong>2 weeks before flight date</strong></kbd>. A miracle.
            <br><br>Not only did I have trouble with my flight ticket, my visa + passport was also damn rabz. My passport and visa was expected to arrive the day before I was to fly. Any later than that, I literally couldnt fly and would have lost alot of money in a no-show. The US embassy literally doesnt care about other citizens. Unlike the SG government, there no minister to complain to if they serve or listen to you. There is a very big risk they wouldve denied my visa or taken their own sweet time to approve it. But the visa still came in time.
            <br><br>When I first made the decision and then remade the decision to go overseas, there was alot of fear and uncertainty. What if things dont work out? Whats going to happen? I had to trust that it would all work out okay and it really did. You have to trust in something, be it God or karma or whatever. And just like how I am able to go on this flight, I hope that you will be able to trust and that things do work out okay for you.

        <div class="card-header display"><h3>A trip to Lake Tahoe<br><h6><em>18 May 2023</em></h6></h3></div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="fw-normal">
            Before I left for the US, my parents got connected to this young family though Ps Kay Kiong. They used to attend Covenant but moved to the Bay Area. This couple is just amazing, they drove my mom and I around for a day trip to San Francisco and recently they invited me on a road trip to <kbd><strong>Lake Tahoe, Nevada</strong></kbd> to go skiing. I came to the US really not expecting much but found myself trying out a sport I never thought i would try and touching snow for the first time. It was unbelievable.
            <br><br>I booked 2 consecutive days of skiing + lessons for <kbd><strong>129 usd</strong></kbd>. It was a damn good deal. On the first day, I went for lessons and it was all ok. On the second day, I went to the counter to get my physical ski tickets. This old guy named Larry said that the 2 consecutive day pass was not available and I had been bumped down to a 1 day pass. Now, I didn't have any ski ticket for the second day and had to buy a new one. I was really deciding not to go skiing because it is damn expensive to get an adult ski ticket + buying on the day itself is more expensive, for a price of <code><strong>225usd</strong></code>.
            <br><br>I decided to just bite the bullet and pay. Went to the counter to find Larry. I asked him how much it would cost. "Whats your name and where are you from?" "Im Jonathan from Singapore, sorry, San Jose" "You know what, I'll call you John from around the area" He was going to give me the special discounted rate for lake tahoe residents.
            <br><br>Suddenly some woman pops out of nowhere, gives Larry a free ski ticket and signs off on it. Larry says "Well I was going to give you the cheaper rate but this is even better, its a free ticket". That was worth <kbd><strong>220sgd</strong></kbd>. Has someone in Singapore ever passed you 220sgd before? This 220sgd is an even smaller sum compared to this Covenant family who drove me to Lake Tahoe(4hr drive), gave me a room in their airbnb to stay for 2 nights, lent me the other ski gear, and also treated me to 2 meals. Utterly inexplicable.
            <br><br>Back in NS, I faced alot of difficulties. Not just from an abusive, toxic boss that I had but also because many things I tried to do just didn't work out. No matter how hard I tried, it always felt like things didn't work, things kept failing. Sometimes I felt like I was set up for failure. I was given a logistics role and demanded the full responsibilities of it despite not being allowed to go through the necessary training; the Junior Logistics Officer Course.
            <br><br>But when I came here, things just work. It's like magic and I really cant believe how it can even happen. Its like walking on the moon for the first time and not feeling gravity. All the fears that I had before coming to the US really paled in comparison to the grace that others have shown me here, even the grace of God at hand in all these. I trusted that things were going to be ok and it has simply exceeded ok by a long shot.
